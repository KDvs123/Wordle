Welcome to the **Wordle Clone Game**, a web-based application that replicates the popular word-guessing game Wordle. Built with React , this game challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts while providing feedback on the accuracy of each guess.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start by guessing a five-letter word and enter it into the grid.
2. The game will provide feedback on the accuracy of your guess:
   - Letters that are correct and in the right position will be highlighted.
   - Letters that are correct but in the wrong position will be marked differently.
   - Letters that are not in the word will remain unhighlighted.
3. Use the feedback to make more informed guesses.
4. You have six attempts to guess the correct word.
5. After six attempts or a correct guess, the game will reveal the hidden word.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Engaging and responsive word-guessing experience.
- **Keyboard Support**: Allows input from both physical and on-screen keyboards.
- **Feedback System**: Provides visual feedback on the accuracy of each guess.
- **Game Logic**: Implements the classic Wordle game rules.
